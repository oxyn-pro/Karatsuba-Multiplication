# Karatsuba-Multiplication
There are different ways of multiplication of the numbers, and every multiplication has its logic algorithm. The Karastuba Multiplication Algorithm consists of several steps that lead to the expected result. This Algorithm is faster than the usual multiplication method (that is taught in the 3rd year at school).
